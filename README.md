  Touch

<p align="center">
In today's highly e-connnected society it can be easy to believe the perception that these conduits of communication; either electronic devices or top social apps can alone fulfill the base needs of human connection. 
<br><br>
However I, along with many other studies believe this to be untrue. Though they provide a great magnitude of utility in various ways they can be steered astray with many other features that dampen and for some completely reverse their intended purpose. 
<br><br>
Touch attempts to be a simple liaison that removes some of the noise from social style applications, and attempts to create a unique and intricate profile of you as a person. This allows us to connect you with other people that yearn for social connection, but often have difficulty finding it in a distracted and disconnected surrounding.
